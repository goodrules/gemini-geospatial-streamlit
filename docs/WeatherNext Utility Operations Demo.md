    * **Benefit:** *Quantitative data, underpinned by WeatherNext's enhanced accuracy for extreme events, to support critical decision-making, ensuring service continuity for essential services and minimizing broad community disruption.*

**IV. Unlocking Deeper Insights Through Conversational AI (5-7 minutes)**

* **Presenter:** "Beyond this initial risk assessment, we can continue the conversation with Gemini. And when we need to understand the range of possibilities, we can leverage **WeatherNext Gen's probabilistic forecasts**." (Research brief, page 4-5)  
  * **Interactive Question 1 (Flood Risk & Access – incorporating probabilistic thinking):**  
    * **Presenter:** "Crew access is always a concern. Let's ask Gemini to consider not just the most likely scenario, but the potential range of impacts for flooding."  
    * **Action:** Presenter types into chat: "Gemini, show critical access roads for crews to reach high-priority lines downtown. Then, using WeatherNext Gen ensemble data, highlight roads with a greater than 30% chance of being impacted by flooding based on the multi-hazard forecast."  
    * **Visual (Chat Left):** Prompt appears.  
    * **Visual (Map Right):** Key access roads are drawn/highlighted. Segments of those roads meeting the probabilistic flood risk threshold change color or get an icon.  
    * **Presenter (Interpreting Map):** "Gemini, using WeatherNext Gen's ensemble, is now showing us not just a single outcome, but the *likelihood* of impact. These roads (points) have a significant chance of flooding. This is a step beyond what many traditional deterministic NWP models can offer for such integrated risk assessment. WeatherNext Gen claims higher skill than even the ECMWF ensemble for many targets." (Research brief, page 5, 17 – WeatherNext Gen skill)  
    * **Insight Generated (Reinforced):** Proactive identification of access challenges with quantifiable probability, enabling more robust contingency planning for crew deployment.

    * **Visual (Chat Left):** Prompt appears.  
    * **Visual (Map Right):** Map might zoom to the wind farm, or a dashboard element/chart appears showing the predicted generation range.  
    * **Presenter (Interpreting Map/Info):** "Okay, WeatherNext Gen gives us a probable range for generation. This is far more useful for managing reserves and grid stability than a single deterministic number, especially given NWP's historical struggles with wind ramps and complex terrain where renewables are often sited." (Research brief, page 9, 11 – NWP limitations for VRE)  
    * **Insight Generated (Reinforced):** Better grid balancing and informed decisions on conventional generation or storage, with a clearer understanding of uncertainty.  
  * **Interactive Question 3 (Wildfire Mitigation Context – if applicable):**  
    * **Presenter:** "And for those in fire-prone areas, understanding the likelihood of critical fire weather is paramount."  
    * **Action:** Presenter types into chat: "Gemini, using WeatherNext Gen, identify transmission corridors in the Western sector with a high probability (e.g., \>60%) of experiencing critical fire weather conditions (high winds, low humidity) in the next 24 hours. Suggest areas for intensified patrol."  
    * **Visual (Chat Left):** Prompt appears.  
    * **Visual (Map Right):** Specific transmission corridors meeting the probabilistic criteria are highlighted.  
    * **Presenter (Interpreting Map/Info):** "WeatherNext Gen allows us to move beyond simple alerts to probabilistic risk assessment for fire weather. This targeted intelligence is invaluable for dynamic mitigation, especially as traditional NWP models can lack the necessary resolution or accuracy for precise localization of these threats." (Research brief, page 8, 13 – NWP limitations for fire weather)  
    * **Insight Generated (Reinforced):** More targeted and confident dynamic wildfire risk mitigation strategies.
