- google maps data as the base? (vs openmaps)
- preprocess BQ datasets for use
    - geospatial core (states, counties, zip, etc)
    - weathernext
    - fake asset data (customer data)
- how will we eventually create the logic and display how data will interact?  e.g. if a user asks about potential damage in the next 5 days, the model and app will have to cross weathernext data with asset data, understand damaging weather and the implications on specific locations of the user data
- improve drawing of polygons
- improve heatmapping and polygon fill-in
