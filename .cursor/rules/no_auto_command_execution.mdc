# No Automatic Command Execution

When making code changes, do not automatically execute any commands like `streamlit run app.py` afterward.

The user already has a Streamlit instance running, so additional command executions are unnecessary and may create duplicate processes.

## How to apply this rule

- Make code changes as requested
- Do not follow up with a terminal command execution unless specifically requested
- Simply inform the user that changes have been made and that they can refresh their existing Streamlit instance
- Only run terminal commands when explicitly asked by the user
