Be mindful of basic security practices. Avoid generating code susceptible to common vulnerabilities like injection attacks (SQL, command), cross-site scripting (XSS) if generating web code, insecure handling of secrets, or using insecure libraries/functions (e.g., `pickle` with untrusted data, weak random number generation for security purposes).
