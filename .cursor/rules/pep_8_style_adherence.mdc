Strictly follow PEP 8 style guidelines for all generated or modified Python code. This includes:
- Naming conventions (snake_case for variables/functions/methods, PascalCase for classes).
- Correct indentation (4 spaces).
- Proper whitespace around operators and after commas.
- Import ordering (standard library, third-party, local application, separated by blank lines).
- Keeping line lengths reasonable (aim for under 80-100 characters where practical).
