High-level modules should not depend directly on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. Use techniques like dependency injection to provide concrete implementations of abstract interfaces (ABCs or Protocols) at runtime, promoting loose coupling.
