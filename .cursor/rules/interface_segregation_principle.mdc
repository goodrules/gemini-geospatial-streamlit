Prefer smaller, more specific interfaces or protocols over large, monolithic ones. Clients (classes or functions using an interface) should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. In Python, this often means defining focused Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) using the `abc` module or using `typing.Protocol` for structural subtyping.
