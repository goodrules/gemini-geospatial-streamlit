# Gemini Geospatial Streamlit

A powerful interactive application that combines Google's Gemini AI with geospatial analysis capabilities, enabling natural language-driven exploration and visualization of geographic data.

![Map Interface Example](screenshot.png)

## üåü Features

- **AI-Powered Chat Interface**: Interact with geospatial data using natural language queries
- **Interactive Map Visualization**: Real-time display of geospatial data with multiple layer support
- **Risk Analysis Tools**: Specialized tools for assessing weather risks to infrastructure
- **Power Line Infrastructure Analysis**: Visualize and analyze power line networks
- **Integrated Weather Data**: Access weather forecasts and analyze weather-related risks

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Google Gemini API key
- Streamlit
- GeoPandas and other geospatial libraries (see `requirements.txt` for full details)

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gemini-geospatial-streamlit.git
   cd gemini-geospatial-streamlit
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```
   PROJECT_ID=your_google_cloud_project_id
   GCS_BUCKET_NAME=your_gcs_bucket_name
   ```

4. **Download supplementary shapefiles**
   ```bash
   python download_gcs_data.py
   ```
   This will download required shapefiles and other geospatial data from the specified GCS bucket to the `data/local` directory.

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

6. **Access the web interface**
   
   Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501

## üß© Architecture

The application is structured into several key components:

- `app.py`: Main entry point for the Streamlit application
- `components/`: UI components including chat interface, map, and sidebar
- `services/`: Core services for Gemini integration, map processing, and risk analysis
- `data/`: Data access and processing modules
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
- `action_handlers/`: Handlers for map actions triggered by AI responses

## üîç Usage Examples

### Ask About Regional Weather Risks

```
"What areas in Pennsylvania are at high risk for wind damage to power lines in the next 3 days?"
```

### Analyze Specific Regions

```
"Show me the power infrastructure in Chester County and highlight areas with potential weather impacts."
```

### Compare Multiple Regions

```
"Compare the weather risks between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh for the next week."
```

## üß† How It Works

1. User submits a query through the chat interface
2. The query is processed by the Gemini AI model with a specialized system prompt
3. Gemini generates a structured response including:
   - Text response for the user
   - Map action instructions
   - Optional structured data for visualization
4. The application processes the map actions to update the interactive map
5. Results are displayed to the user in both chat and map interfaces

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

You can configure the application behavior in the sidebar, including:

- Model parameters
- Feature toggles for specific capabilities
- Date selection for weather forecasts
- Debug panel for viewing system prompts and API responses

## üìä Data Sources

The application uses several data sources:

- Weather forecast data
- US geographic boundaries (states, counties)
- Power infrastructure data for Pennsylvania
- Custom local datasets (as configured)
- Supplementary shapefiles stored in a GCS bucket specified by the `GCS_BUCKET_NAME` environment variable
