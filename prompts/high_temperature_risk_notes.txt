IMPORTANT: When users ask about power lines at risk from HIGH TEMPERATURES, extreme heat affecting power infrastructure, 
or power line sag and faults due to heat, use the "high_temperature_risk" action type to analyze temperature risk to power lines.

This action identifies areas where temperatures exceed dangerous thresholds that can cause power line sag, reduced capacity, 
and electrical faults. High temperatures can cause conductor expansion and sag, potentially leading to outages.

IMPORTANT: Remember that weather data from the service is provided in Kelvin. The handler will automatically
convert Kelvin to Fahrenheit for threshold comparisons and visualization.

IMPORTANT: Power line data is available for the entire United States. You can analyze high temperature risk 
to power lines in any US state or county.

IMPORTANT: ALL parameters shown in the examples MUST be included in your responses, even if they match the defaults.

The "high_temperature_risk" action supports the following parameters:
- "region": Any US state or county to analyze (e.g., "Texas", "California", "Maricopa County, AZ")
- "max_temp_f": Maximum safe temperature in Fahrenheit (user can specify any threshold, default: 95). Areas above this are highlighted
- "forecast_days": Number of days to analyze from the selected init_date (default: 3)
- "forecast_date": Specific date for analysis (format: "YYYY-MM-DD") - alternative to forecast_days
- "analyze_power_lines": Boolean to show power lines overlay and risk intersection (default: true)

IMPORTANT: Extract the user's preferred temperature threshold from their query if provided. For example:
- "temperatures above 100 degrees" → max_temp_f: 100
- "areas hotter than 105°F" → max_temp_f: 105
- "extreme heat above 110 degrees" → max_temp_f: 110

This action analyzes risk at specific forecast timestamps (06:00, 12:00, 18:00 UTC) within the specified number of days.

The action provides the following insights:
- Heat map visualization of areas with dangerous high temperatures
- Power line locations overlaid on the temperature map
- Power lines in high temperature zones are highlighted
- Count of affected power line segments in dangerous temperature areas

Examples:

For showing high temperature risk to power lines in New York on a specific date:
{
    "response": "I've analyzed high temperature risk to power lines in New York for June 24, 2025. The map shows areas where temperatures exceed 95°F that could cause power line sag and faults, with affected power line infrastructure highlighted.",
    "map_actions": [
        {
            "action_type": "high_temperature_risk",
            "max_temp_f": 95,
            "forecast_date": "2025-06-24",  
            "region": "New York",
            "analyze_power_lines": true
        }
    ]
}

For showing high temperature risk to power lines in Texas:
{
    "map_actions": [
        {
            "action_type": "high_temperature_risk",
            "max_temp_f": 95,
            "forecast_days": 3,  
            "region": "Texas",
            "analyze_power_lines": true
        }
    ]
}

For showing extreme heat risk in California:
{
    "map_actions": [
        {
            "action_type": "high_temperature_risk",
            "max_temp_f": 105,
            "forecast_days": 7,  
            "region": "California",
            "analyze_power_lines": true
        }
    ]
}

For showing high temperature risk in a specific county:
{
    "map_actions": [
        {
            "action_type": "high_temperature_risk",
            "max_temp_f": 110,
            "forecast_days": 3,  
            "region": "Maricopa County, AZ",
            "analyze_power_lines": true
        }
    ]
}

For showing dangerous high temperatures with a user-specified threshold:
{
    "map_actions": [
        {
            "action_type": "high_temperature_risk",
            "max_temp_f": 115,
            "forecast_days": 5,  
            "region": "Arizona",
            "analyze_power_lines": true
        }
    ]
