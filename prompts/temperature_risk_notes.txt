IMPORTANT: When users ask about unsafe temperatures, extreme cold, or oil wells affected by temperature in ANY US region,
use the "unsafe_temperature" action type to visualize areas with dangerously low temperatures and affected oil wells.

The action assesses areas where temperatures fall below a dangerous threshold (user-specified or default 20°F).
In these extremely cold conditions, infrastructure operations can be affected or equipment can fail.

IMPORTANT: Remember that weather data from the service is provided in Kelvin. The handler will automatically
convert Kelvin to Fahrenheit for threshold comparisons and visualization.

IMPORTANT: While the action was originally designed for North Dakota oil wells, the temperature visualization 
works for ANY US state or county. Oil well data is currently only available for North Dakota, so the oil well 
overlay will only display when "region" is set to "North Dakota".

IMPORTANT: ALL parameters shown in the examples MUST be included in your responses, even if they match the defaults.

The "unsafe_temperature" action supports the following parameters:
- "region": Any US state or county to analyze (e.g., "Michigan", "Texas", "Los Angeles County, CA")
- "min_temp_f": Minimum safe temperature in Fahrenheit (user can specify any threshold). Areas below this are highlighted
- "forecast_timestamp": Specific timestamp for weather data in ISO format (e.g., "{{tomorrow_date}}T06:00:00Z")
- "forecast_date": Date for weather data if no specific timestamp (format: "YYYY-MM-DD")
- "show_oil_wells": Boolean to show oil wells overlay (only works when region is "North Dakota")

IMPORTANT: Extract the user's preferred temperature threshold from their query if provided. For example:
- "temperatures below 15 degrees" → min_temp_f: 15
- "areas colder than 5°F" → min_temp_f: 5
- "extreme cold below -10 degrees" → min_temp_f: -10

IMPORTANT: Like other weather forecasts, this action is only available at specific times: 
06:00 UTC, 12:00 UTC, and 18:00 UTC for each forecast day.

The action provides the following insights:
- Heat map visualization of areas with unsafe temperatures
- Oil well locations overlaid on the temperature map (North Dakota only)
- Wells in unsafe temperature zones are highlighted in red (North Dakota only)
- Count of affected wells out of total wells is displayed (North Dakota only)

Examples:

For showing unsafe low temperatures in North Dakota with oil wells:
{
    "map_actions": [
        {
            "action_type": "unsafe_temperature",
            "min_temp_f": 20,
            "forecast_date": "{{today_date}}",  
            "region": "North Dakota",
            "show_oil_wells": true
        }
    ]
}

For showing extreme cold in another state (without oil wells):
{
    "map_actions": [
        {
            "action_type": "unsafe_temperature",
            "min_temp_f": 10,
            "forecast_date": "{{tomorrow_date}}",  
            "region": "Minnesota",
            "show_oil_wells": false
        }
    ]
}

For showing unsafe temperatures in a specific county:
{
    "map_actions": [
        {
            "action_type": "unsafe_temperature",
            "min_temp_f": 15,
            "forecast_date": "{{today_date}}",  
            "region": "Cook County, IL",
            "show_oil_wells": false
        }
    ]
}

For showing dangerously cold temperatures with a user-specified threshold:
{
    "map_actions": [
        {
            "action_type": "unsafe_temperature",
            "min_temp_f": -5,
            "forecast_date": "{{today_date}}",  
            "region": "Alaska",
            "show_oil_wells": false
        }
    ]
}
